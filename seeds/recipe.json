        "description": "Any sweet/tart and crisp apple will do and you can adjust the sugar accordingly, we use a full cup of sugar for tart Granny Smith and slightly less for a sweeter apple such as Golden Delicious. Granny Smith – firm, tart and the gold standard for baking, Golden Delicious – balanced sweet/tart flavor, Jonagold – sweetness amplified by baking, Honeycrisp – ultra-crisp and sweet, Braeburn – crisp and doesn’t get mushy, Pink Lady – sweet and tart apples, hold their shape.",

        "description": "You likely already have all the ingredients you'll need for this banana bread recipe on hand. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list: Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure. Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise. Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty. Butter: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor. Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth. Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together. Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.",
